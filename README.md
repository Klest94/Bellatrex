 This repository contains the detailed final results and relative statistical analysis of the manuscript for the BELLATREX method, currently under revision.
 
 The model's code, prediction, and tuned hyperparameters will be shared upon acceptance.


## Instructions
 
 
To guarantee that the script runs correctly, run BELLATREX on a Python environment that matches the requirements indicated in `requirements.txt`. Slightly older versions might also work, but `DeprecationWarning` messages will be raised.

The user can replicate the examples from the paper by simply running 
`main_example.py`.


## Additional material

the ``FULL RESULTS.md`` file shares more information about the datasets employed to validate Bellatrex, as well as a detailed view of the results.
